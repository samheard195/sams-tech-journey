# sams-tech-journey
This github space is for Sam Heard and will be a space to share my technical examples when required.

As of January 2023 at the time of writing, I am currently the sole EMEA Solution Architect at deputy.com.
I do not have a coding background but have matured into the region's platform expert and from time to time have created command line API scripts.

I like to make things really easy for my colleagues, therefore I created a document full of Deputy scripts that can be used to call the API.  I have created a document that can transform data from cells into a dynamic json stringify call using a concatenation of fields.  I designed this for both internal consultants and external partners that do not have any technical experience and need to use the Deputy API to create and update large amounts of data.  Ask me if you'd like to see this!
