# sams-tech-journey
This github space is for Sam Heard and will be a space to share my technical examples when required.

As of January 2023 at the time of writing, I am currently the sole EMEA Solution Architect at deputy.com.
I do not have a coding background but have matured into the region's platform expert and from time to time have created command line API scripts.
